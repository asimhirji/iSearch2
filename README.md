# iSearch: A visual search mobile app for iOS

This repository contains the code of a prototype iOS app developed for
the Information Retrieval course in Fall 2018.

Our implementation is based off CloudSight API's sample project for[Swift]
(https://github.com/cloudsight/cloudsight-objc).

Being an initial prototype, our implementation is rough, albeit fully functional.

Our main contributions can be found in the `CloudSightExample/` sub-directory.
